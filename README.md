# SRT411-Assignment-0
Readme file, Rmd file, and PDF file of assignment 0, "Introduction to R and Github", are required to complete assignment 0 of SRT411. Any of the ToDo coding exercises are based off from the article, "A (Very) Short Introduction to R", of the authors, Paul Torfs and Claudia Brauer, under the Hydrology and Quantitative Water Management Group by the Wageningen University (The Netherlands) on March 3rd, 2014.  R is a language for statisticall computing and graphics under a public domain (GNU) project, which is the only language that assignment 0 is about. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  These instructions do not have to be followed in order.  Developing and testing the project was done under a Windows-based operating system host machine.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

R Prorgamming Language at [here](https://www.r-project.org/)

RStudio Independent Development Environment for R at [here](https://www.rstudio.com/)
```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")
```

## Running the tests

Click on the **Knit** button within RStudio.  Use dropdown menu to choose between HTML webpage, PDF file, or Word document.  Be sure to set a working directory with RStudio by clicking on Session dropdown menu, then by hovering over Set Working Directory menu, and then by clicking on Choose Directory option.

### And coding style tests

The purpose of running these codes is to explain what R language can do with examples and exerices for clarification to people without any programming experience.
